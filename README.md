##### Background Information
The Hukumnama refers to a hymn from a randomly selected left-hand side page from the Guru Granth Sahib on a daily basis in the morning. This is seen as the order of God for that particular day. The Hukamnama is distributed and then read aloud in Gurdwaras throughout the world. (Read here for more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukamnama)
